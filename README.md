# cloud-notes-app_
A simple cloud-based notes app hosted on AWS S3 using static website hosting.
A simple and clean Notes Web App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, deployed on Vercel and version-controlled via GitHub.

This project allows users to create, view, save, and delete notes directly in their browser using localStorage, ensuring notes remain even after refreshing the page.

🚀 Features

✔️ Create new notes
✔️ Save notes locally
✔️ Delete notes
✔️ Auto-save functionality
✔️ Clean and aesthetic UI
✔️ Responsive design
✔️ Fully deployed on Vercel
✔️ GitHub repository connected for continuous deployment

🧠 How It Works

The app uses:

HTML → structure

CSS → UI design & styling

JavaScript → logic & note management

localStorage → to store user notes inside the browser

Whenever a user types a note, it is automatically saved and restored when the page reloads.
